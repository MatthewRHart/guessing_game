Favorite Food Game

The game I created has a basic two if/else format.

The first prompt will ask, "what's my favorite food?". If input is correct, a winning message appears. If wrong, a try again message with a hint appears. After the hint "try again" appears referring to the first question. If right, a winning message appears, if wrong, you lose and the game ends.

Format below.


Guess 1
if (win)

else (wrong, guess 2)
  if (win)

  else (wrong, game over)

)

Answer is pizza.
